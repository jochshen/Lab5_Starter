1. No, unit testing wouldn't be as applicable for testing this 'largeer' scale feature. Unit tests might not be able to capture how features interact within the application, such as receving and displaying messages. Instead, unit tests are supposed to test indiivdual parts. For example, you could unit test to see if the applicatino is properly saving the message the user wants to send. You could add a unit test to see if the application sends the proper response code after sending a generic message. 
2. Yes, unit testing is very applicable for the "max message length" feature of this applicaiton since it can automatically and quickly verify whether a message is more than 80 characters. Testing this encapsulated aspect of character count would definetely be a good use of unit testing.
